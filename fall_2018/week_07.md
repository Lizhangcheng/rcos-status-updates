Week 7(NOV 06)
## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last weekend, I start to learning Flask, which is the samll web framework in python. I have done some small practice with flask and upload that to github.
## This Week's Plan
For this week,I will continue to work on learning flask, and I hope at the end of this week, I will be able to make use a flask to make a small web by flask.
## Anything Blocking?
When I was reading the documentation for flask, I find that even though I know how to use the systex of flask, I cannot fully understand why the systex is like this. For example, when we use flask to create the URL, the first route address is always '/50000', but I do not know why should be this. And I will try to find the answer for this.
