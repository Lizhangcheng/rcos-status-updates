Week 11(DEC 04)
## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last weekend, I have have read the documentation about template use in Flask and practiced it by making login page and review the work I have done before. And I have submit the files I created to github and add commits.
## This Week's Plan
This week, I would continue to improve the login page and make it become beatiful and easy to use.
## Anything Blocking?
