Week 7(NOV 06)
## Last Week's Accomplishments
last week, it has been a pretty busy week, I had two midterm exams. So I didnot have much time to continue learning flask.
## This Week's Plan
This week, me and my project mate will start to think about to make a login page for our project, and we will implement that by flask.
## Anything Blocking?
