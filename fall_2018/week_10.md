Week 10(NOV 27)
## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week is thanks giving, and my parents have travelled from china. So I did not do much progress, but yesterday, I had a conversation with my teammate Jiahang Wang. We had decided the layout of the Login Page, and due to the convinience of HTML template. We can import the rady to use template, and we have made a very simple login page.
## This Week's Plan
This week, we will add more features to the Login page.
## Anything Blocking?
We meet a problem that when user typing the password, it shows what the user typed. Still looking forsolutions....
