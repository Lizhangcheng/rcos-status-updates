Week 6(OCT 30)
## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I have read the database file for our porject and add some error checking funtions for the project and also, the database part for our project is quit compelet and I will contact with the leader of our project to see what else I can do to improve the project.
## This Week's Plan
This Week, I will have a conversation with the leader of our group to find out where I can actually help other than database.
## Anything Blocking?
Yes, I am always confusing what should I do in this group and I am not used to give myself assigment. However, I really want to help the project to do something but I have no idea what to do.
