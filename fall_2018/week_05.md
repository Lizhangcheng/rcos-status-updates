Week 5(OCT 23)
## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I have finished and submit the midterm evaluation form for rcos, and I created a new file nameed "realDatabase" to start to the real database work for our project, because we were practicing in another file, trying to learn add,delete and selete for mysql. But now we are really getting into the project.
## This Week's Plan
This Week, I should be able to finish rewriting the insert and delete helper functions for autograding.
## Anything Blocking?
there are some problems occuring when I tried to import some file from our project, we are still figuring out why.
